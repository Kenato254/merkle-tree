# Merkle Tree
- In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every "leaf" (node) is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labeled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)

- A Merkle tree allows efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure. A Merkle tree is a generalization of a hash list and a hash chain.

## Uses
- Merkle trees can be used to verify any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers.

## Real World implementation
- Bitcoin.
- IPSF.
- BitTorrent.
- GIT.
